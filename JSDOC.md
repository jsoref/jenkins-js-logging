Client-side Logging APIs for Jenkins.

<hr />

# API

This API supports <u>_hierarchical logging categories_</u> i.e. if the log [Level] for a category is not configured (see [setLogLevel]), the log [Level] for that category will come from the "dot parent" category i.e. if you create a logger for category "`a.b.c`", but "`a.b.c`" is not configured with a log [Level], it will check and use the log level configured on "`a.b`" etc.

## logger(category)
Create a [Logger] instance for logging to the specified category.

* <u>category</u>: The log category for the logger. See above notes on _hierarchical logging categories_. 

__Note__: The [Logger] instance will default to [Level.ERROR] if the category is not configured (and none of it's "dot parents").

```javascript
const logging = require('@jenkins-cd/logging');
const logger = logging.logger('org.jenkinsci.sse');

// Log messages ...
if (logger.isDebugEnabled()) {
    logger.debug('Log a message for x and y values: ', x , y);
}
```

See the [Logger] class for detail on the [Logger] methods.
 
## setLogLevel(category, [level])
Set the logging [Level] for the specified log category. 

* <u>category</u>: The log category to be configured. See above notes on _hierarchical logging categories_. 
* <u>level</u>: The log [Level].

This function is intended for use by browser tooling (e.g. Chrome Developer Extension) for configuring the log levels.

```javascript
const logging = require('@jenkins-cd/logging');

logging.setLogLevel('org.jenkinsci.sse', logging.Level.DEBUG);
```
 
See the "Browser Configuration" section below for information on how to discover and configure log levels in the browser.
 
## getCategoriesStorageNS
Get the [`StorageNamespace`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@jenkins-cd/storage) used to store log level configurations.

This function is intended for use by browser tooling (e.g. Chrome Developer Extension) for configuring the log levels.

# Browser Configuration

This logging package uses browser [`localStorage`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en/docs/Web/API/Window/localStorage) for storing log settings. __We have a Developer tool Extension for the Google Chrome browser__ (see below), making it easy to discover and configure log levels in Chrome. For other browsers (see below also), you need to use their "Storage Inspector" to discover and configure the log levels. Of course, it's also possible to use the Developer Console in any browser to programmatically set log levels via the [Storage API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Storage).

Configuring log levels in the Storage Inspector of any of the Browsers is a simple process of locating the key for the log category of interest (all log category keys have a "`jenkins-instance/logging/categories:`" prefix) and changing it's value to the desired [Level] i.e. `DEBUG`, `LOG`, `INFO`, `WARN`, `ERROR`. See the following sections for specific examples. 

## Google Chrome

The easiest way to configure logging levels in Google Chrome is via the [Jenkins Logging Chrome Devtools Extension](https://github.com/tfennelly/jenkins-logging-chrome-ext). Once installed, a new "Jenkins Logging" tab will be added to the Developer Tools.

Of course, it's also possible use Google Chrome's Storage inspector.

## Firefox

The following image shows Firefox's Storage inspector. Note that the Storage Inspector in Firefox is not enabled by default, so you'll need to enable it [in the Developer tools Settings](./images/firefox-settings.png) if it's not already enabled.

Note that Firefox has a useful "filter" field for narrowing the visible set of stored name/value pairs. Enter "jenkins-instance/logging/categories".

## Safari

The following image shows Safari's Storage inspector. Note that the Developer tools in Safari is not enabled by default (and therefore the Storage Inspector), so you'll need to enable it [in the Advanced section of the Browser Settings](./images/safari-settings.png) if it's not already enabled.
